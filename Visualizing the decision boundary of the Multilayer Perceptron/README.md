## **In this exercise, we will use the Iris dataset to evaluate the performance of the perceptron and visualize the capabilities it provides for classifying different categories within a dataset.**



The Iris flower dataset, or Fisher's Iris dataset, is a multivariate dataset introduced by Ronald Fisher in his 1936 article "The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems" as an example of linear discriminant analysis. Sometimes, it is called the Anderson Iris dataset because Edgar Anderson collected the data to quantify the morphological variation of the Iris flower from three related species. Two of the three species were collected on the Gasp√© Peninsula "all from the same pasture, and picked on the same day and measured at the same time by the same person with the same apparatus."

The dataset contains 50 samples of each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica, and Iris versicolor). Four traits were measured for each sample: the length and width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters. Based on the combination of these four traits, Fisher developed a linear discriminant model to distinguish between one species and another.
