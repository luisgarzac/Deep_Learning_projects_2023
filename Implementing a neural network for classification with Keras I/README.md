Steps for implementing an Artificial Neural Network in Keras:

Define your training dataset: input and output vectors.
Define the architecture of the Artificial Neural Network.
Configure the learning process by selecting an error function, an optimization function, and different metrics to monitor the process.
Train the ANN with your training dataset using the fit() method.
