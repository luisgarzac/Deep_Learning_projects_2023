## **Case Study - Sentiment Classification**


Dataset
This dataset consists of 25,000 movie reviews from IMDB (Internet Movie Database) labeled by sentiment (positive/negative). The reviews have been preprocessed, and each review is encoded as a list of word indices (integers). For convenience, the words are indexed by overall frequency in the dataset, so that for example the integer "3" encodes the third most frequent word in the data. This allows for quick filtering operations such as considering only the top 10,000 most common words.
