## **The objective of this exercise is to use a multilayer perceptron for identifying the person who is speaking from a one-second long audio clip.**


This dataset contains speeches from prominent leaders including Benjamin Netanyahu, Jens Stoltenberg, Julia Gillard, Margaret Thatcher, and Nelson Mandela, which also represent the folder names. Each audio in the folder is a one-second long PCM with a sampling rate of 16000 Hz encoding. A folder named background_noise contains audios that are not speeches but can be found in the surroundings of the speaker, for example, audience laughing or applauding. It can be mixed with the speech while training.
