# Deep_Learning_projects_2023

> In this repository, you will find deep learning projects where models are created to solve different problems, from cancer diagnosis to predicting housing prices or identifying the owner of audio recordings. We visualize the performance of the models by changing their parameters until finding the appropriate one.


Each folder within this repository is a different project, documenting the dataset used and establishing the objective of each project. The codes are written in Python in Jupyter Notebook.
