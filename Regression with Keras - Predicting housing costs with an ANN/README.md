## **Regression with Keras - Predicting housing costs with an ANN.**
## **The objective of our regression problem is to use the first 13 features to predict the value of MEDV (which represents the housing price).**

Dataset
Description
This dataset contains information collected by the US Census Service on housing in the Boston Mass area. It was obtained from the StatLib file (http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/datasets/boston), and has been widely used throughout the literature to compare different Machine Learning algorithms.

The data was originally published by Harrison, D. and Rubinfeld, D.L. Hedonic prices and the demand for clean air', J. Environ. Economics & Management, vol.5, 81-102, 1978.

Dataset Features
The dataset is small, with only 506 cases. It contains 14 features that are described below:

CRIM: per capita crime rate by town
ZN: proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft.
INDUS: proportion of non-retail business acres per town.
CHAS: Charles River dummy variable (1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise)
NOX: nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million)
RM: average number of rooms per dwelling
AGE: proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940
DIS: weighted distances to five Boston employment centres
RAD: index of accessibility to radial highways
TAX: full-value property-tax rate per 10,000 dollars
PTRATIO: pupil-teacher ratio by town
B: 1000(Bk — 0.63)² where Bk is the proportion of blacks by town
LSTAT: % lower status of the population
MEDV: Median value of owner-occupied homes in 1000 dollars
