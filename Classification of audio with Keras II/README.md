## **The objective of this exercise is to use a multi-layer perceptron for the identification of the person who is speaking from an audio of one second duration.**


Dataset
This dataset contains speeches from prominent leaders such as Benjamin Netanyahu, Jens Stoltenberg, Julia Gillard, Margaret Thatcher, and Nelson Mandela, which also represent folder names. Each audio in the folder is a 1-second long PCM with a sampling rate of 16000 Hz encoded. A folder called background_noise contains audios that are not speeches but can be found inside the speaker's environment, such as the audience laughing or applauding. It can be mixed with the speech while training.
