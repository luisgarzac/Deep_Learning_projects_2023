## **text Classification with Adam**

Adam is an optimization algorithm that is widely used in machine learning for training deep neural networks. It is a combination of two other optimization techniques: adaptive gradient descent and momentum. The name "Adam" is derived from "adaptive moment estimation".


Dataset

This is a dataset of 11,228 Reuters news articles, labeled into 46 topics.

It was originally generated by analyzing and preprocessing the classic Reuters-21578 dataset, but the preprocessing code is no longer packaged with Keras.

Each news article is encoded as a list of word indices (integers). For convenience, words are indexed by their overall frequency in the dataset, so for example the integer "3" encodes the third most frequent word in the data. This allows for fast filtering operations such as "consider only the top 10,000 most common words, but remove the top 20 most common words."
