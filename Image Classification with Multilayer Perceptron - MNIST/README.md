## **In this practical use case, we are going to retrieve the image classification exercise we did in the previous section and try to improve it by applying a Multilayer Perceptron.**


The MNIST database (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database) is a large database of handwritten digits commonly used for training various image processing systems. The database is also widely used for training and testing in the field of machine learning. It was created by "shuffling" the samples from the original NIST datasets. The creators considered that since the NIST training dataset was taken from employees of the United States Census Bureau, while the testing dataset was taken from high school students in the United States, it was not very suitable for machine learning experiments. Additionally, the black and white NIST images were normalized to fit within a bounding box of 28x28 pixels, which introduced levels of grayscale.

The MNIST database contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images. Half of the training set and the other half of the test set were taken from the NIST training dataset, while the other half of the training set and the other half of the test set were taken from the NIST testing dataset. The original creators of the database maintain a list of some of the methods tested on it. In their original paper, they used a support vector machine to achieve an error rate of 0.8%. In 2017, an expanded dataset similar to MNIST called EMNIST was published, which contains 240,000 training images and 40,000 test images of handwritten digits and characters.
